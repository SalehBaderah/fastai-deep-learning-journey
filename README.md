# fastai-deep-learning-journey

This repository contains my progress, codes, notes, and experiments from my deep learning journey through the book **"Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch"** by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger.

## Goals
-  **Gain Knowledge:** Deepen my understanding of deep learning through practical experiments.
-  **Master Tools:** Get familiar with the (PyTorch, fastai, etc.).
-  **Build Projects:** Implement real-world deep learning models and projects.

## Tools
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyTorch, fastai
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks
